	Abstract = {A quantitative synthetic Schlieren imaging (SSI) method based on fast Fourier demodulation is presented. Instead of a random dot pattern (as usually employed in SSI), a 2D periodic pattern (such as a checkerboard) is used as a backdrop to the refractive object of interest. The range of validity and accuracy of this ``Fast Checkerboard Demodulation'' (FCD) method are assessed using both synthetic data and experimental recordings of patterns optically distorted by small waves on a water surface. It is found that the FCD method is at least as accurate as sophisticated, multi-stage, digital image correlation (DIC) or optical flow (OF) techniques used with random dot patterns, and it is significantly faster. Efficient, fully vectorized, implementations of both the FCD and DIC/OF schemes developed for this study are made available as open source Matlab scripts.},

The loss modulus of viscoelastic materials has been incorporated into the theory, and its effects observed experimentally. The spectra were measured using a system that combines light reflection, statistical noise reduction through averaged correlations, and confocal microscopy. It requires only a small area of the interface (\\$\\sim1\\,\\mu\\$m\\$^2\\$), relatively short times for measurements (\\$\\lesssim\\$ few min), and can also be applied to highly viscous materials.}",

In contrast to the moire contouring technique, a grating pattern projected onto the object surface is Fourier-transformed and processed in its spatial frequency domain as well as in its space-signal domain. This technique has a much higher sensitivity than the conventional moire technique and is capable of fully automatic distinction between a depression and an elevation on the object surface. There is no requirement for assigning fringe orders and interpolating data in the regions between contour fringes. The technique is free from errors caused by spurious moire fringes generated by the higher harmonic components of the grating pattern.},

In the present work, the superfluid flow and concentrated quantized vortices induced by a cryogenic motor immersed in superfluid 4He were investigated. Using a motor with six blades in a cylinder caused the free surface of the superfluid 4He to take on a parabolic shape, indicating that the motor produces a rotating superfluid flow. To drive a suction flow in superfluid helium, the motor was mounted in a cylindrical container with a small hole at the center of the top and a slit at the side, acting as a superfluid pump. This pump was successfully used to generate a spiral flow and a vortex with a funnel-shaped core in superfluid 4He, suggesting that the resulting suction flow transports and centralizes quantized vortices to the suction hole, increasing the vortex circulation and sucking the free surface of the superfluid down.}
